# arr-media-monitor
Scripts to look at your media library and the *arr programs to stop monitoring things the
"arr" apps thinks you already have.

*NOTE*: use at your own risk; this has been working for me for months, but I make no
claims that it will work for you.  It does call radarr APIs that modify settings, so there
is some risk that something goes awry.  Backup your stuff first.

## installation

Either `pip install requests`, or set up your favorite virtual environment with the
`requirements.txt` file provided.

## radarr
Run radarr-monitor.py.  Use `-h` for options.

## sonarr
TBD.
